# World Inequality Dashboard

This Dashboard is exploring inequality in the World and its evolution. The indicator used is the Gini Coefficient.   
A low Gini coefficient means low level of inequality. For reference, the minimum in the data is 20.7 and the maximum is 65.8.  
The Dashboard also explores the potential correlations between inequality and other indicators.
